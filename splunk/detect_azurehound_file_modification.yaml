  description: Detects creation or modification of AzureHound output files
  documentation: |
    # Quick Explanation
    This detection identifies file system events where AzureHound output files, such as
    *-azurecollection.zip or *-az*.json, are created or modified, signaling possible Azure
    environment reconnaissance.

    # Analysis of the Event
    The detection targets files with names matching AzureHound patterns (e.g.,
    *-azurecollection.zip, *-azprivroleadminrights.json), which are generated during
    reconnaissance of Azure configurations. It uses `file_actions: modify_related` to
    capture creation or modification events, with `bases` specifying the file patterns.
    AzureHound is a tool used to extract sensitive Azure data, and its outputs suggest an
    attacker is gathering information about cloud resources, roles, or permissions.

    # Implications
    In CI/CD, staging, or production environments, such file activity could indicate an
    attacker mapping Azure resources for privilege escalation or data exfiltration. In
    production, this threatens cloud infrastructure security, potentially exposing
    sensitive data or configurations. In CI/CD, it could compromise pipelines interacting
    with Azure resources, leading to broader attacks.

    # Recommended Actions
    Isolate systems where these files are detected to prevent further reconnaissance.
    Investigate the process and user responsible for the file activity to identify the
    attack vector. Review Azure audit logs for unauthorized access or configuration
    changes. Block or monitor processes generating these files using endpoint security
    tools. Strengthen Azure access controls, enforce least-privilege policies, and audit
    service principal usage to mitigate reconnaissance risks.
