  description: Detects Java processes that create or modify JSP files
  documentation: |
    # Quick Explanation
    This detection identifies when Java processes (`java`, `javaw`, or other JVM
    executables) create or modify JSP files (`*.jsp`) on Linux systems, a common indicator
    of attackers deploying web shells for persistent remote access.

    # Analysis of the Event
    The detection monitors file system events where JSP files are created or modified by
    Java processes, which are identified by process names like `java`, `javaw`, or other
    JVM executables such as those in application servers (Tomcat, JBoss, etc.). The
    `file_actions: modify_related` captures creation or modification events, with `bases`
    specifying the `*.jsp` file pattern and an `arbitrary` rule filtering for Java-related
    process names. JSP files are often used in web applications, and their creation by
    Java processes outside legitimate contexts suggests malicious activity, such as web
    shell deployment to enable remote command execution.

    # Implications
    In CI/CD, staging, or production Linux environments, such activity could indicate an
    attacker establishing persistent access via a web shell, leading to unauthorized
    control, data exfiltration, or further compromise. In CI/CD, this might expose
    sensitive build artifacts or credentials. In production, it could enable attackers to
    manipulate web applications, disrupt services, or escalate privileges, severely
    impacting system security and availability.

    # Recommended Actions
    Immediately isolate Linux systems where JSP files are created or modified by Java
    processes to prevent further compromise. Investigate the Java process's origin, user,
    and parent process to identify the attack vector. Analyze the JSP file content for
    malicious code and remove unauthorized files. Enhance endpoint monitoring to detect
    similar file activities and restrict Java process execution to trusted applications.
    Implement web application firewalls to block malicious web shell interactions and
    audit web server directories for unauthorized JSP files.
