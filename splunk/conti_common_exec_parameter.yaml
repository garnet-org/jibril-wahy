  description: Detects process executions with arguments indicative of Conti ransomware
  documentation: |
    # Quick Explanation
    This detection identifies process executions with command-line arguments commonly used
    by Conti ransomware, indicating potential encryption of local or network data.

    # Analysis of the Event
    The detection targets processes with arguments like `-m local`, `-m net`, `-m all`, or
    `-nomutex`, which are characteristic of Conti ransomware operations. These parameters
    instruct the ransomware to encrypt local drives, network shares, all accessible data,
    or bypass mutex checks to avoid detection. The use of `file_actions: execve` ensures
    the detection captures the execution of such processes, leveraging `arbitrary` rules
    to filter specific command-line patterns.

    # Implications
    In CI/CD, staging, or production environments, detecting these executions suggests a
    ransomware attack that could encrypt critical data, disrupt operations, or lead to
    data loss. Conti ransomware often exfiltrates data before encryption, posing risks to
    data confidentiality and integrity. In production, this could halt services, while in
    CI/CD, it could compromise build pipelines or sensitive artifacts.

    # Recommended Actions
    Immediately isolate affected systems to prevent further encryption or lateral
    movement. Investigate the processâ€™s origin, parent process, and network activity to
    identify the infection vector. Restore critical data from backups after verifying
    their integrity. Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor for
    similar executions. Update security policies to restrict unauthorized process
    executions and enhance network share access controls.
