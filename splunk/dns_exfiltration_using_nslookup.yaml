  description: Detects nslookup executions with arguments that may indicate exfiltration attempts.
  documentation: |
    # Quick Explanation
    This detection identifies executions of `nslookup` with command-line arguments like
    `-querytype=`, `-qt=`, `-q=`, `-type=`, or `-retry=`, which are often used to
    exfiltrate data via DNS queries.

    # Analysis of the Event
    The detection targets `nslookup` processes with arguments associated with DNS query
    manipulation or retries, such as `-querytype=`, `-qt=`, `-q=`, `-type=`, or `-retry=`.
    These patterns suggest potential misuse for encoding and transmitting data to
    attacker-controlled DNS servers. The `file_actions: execve` captures these executions,
    and an `arbitrary` rule filters for the specific command-line patterns, enabling
    detection of covert data exfiltration attempts.

    # Implications
    In CI/CD, staging, or production environments, such executions could indicate
    attackers exfiltrating sensitive data (e.g., credentials, configurations) via DNS,
    bypassing traditional network monitoring. In CI/CD, this could expose pipeline secrets
    or artifacts. In production, it risks data breaches, intellectual property theft, or
    further compromise, as DNS traffic is often less scrutinized.

    # Recommended Actions
    Isolate systems showing these execution patterns to prevent data exfiltration. Analyze
    network DNS logs to identify queried domains and block suspicious ones at the
    firewall. Investigate the processâ€™s origin, user, and parent process to trace the
    attack vector. Deploy endpoint detection tools to monitor for similar nslookup misuse.
    Implement DNS query logging and anomaly detection to catch covert channels, and
    restrict nslookup execution to authorized users or processes.
